Everywhere I'm turning
Nothing seems complete
Stand up and I'm searching
For the better part of me

I hang my head from sorrow
State of humanity
I wear it on my shoulders
Gotta find the strength in me

'Cause I am a superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is

See, even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a superwoman

This is for

For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
To come home before the sun

And all my sisters coming together
Say yes I will
Yes I can

'Cause I am a superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is

See, even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a superwoman

When I'm breaking down
And I can't be found
'Cause I start to get weak
'Cause no one knows me underneath these clothes

But I can fly
We can fly, oh

'Cause I am a superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is

See, even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a superwoman

Oh, let me tell you, I am a superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is (oh, yeah)

See, even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yeah, I'm a superwoman

Yes I am
And I'm a superwoman
Yes you are
Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah
I'm super (so super)
I'm super (so super)

Yes I am (yes I am)
Yes we are (yeah)
Yes I am
Yes you are
